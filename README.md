# BioNER
Biomedical Named Entity Recognition and Disease Clustering.

The large volume of biomedical literature necessitates advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions for efficient knowledge extraction. This project presents a comprehensive approach to Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Cluster Analysis, targeting disease-related keywords extraction and relationship unveiling within biomedical texts. Leveraging state-of-the-art Large Language Models, including BERT and ELECTRA, fine-tuned on biomedical data, our system achieved promising results, surpassing baseline metrics with an F1 score of 0.7.
